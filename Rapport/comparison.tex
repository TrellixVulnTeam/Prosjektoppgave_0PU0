\section{Amazon Web Services}
Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing provider that offers a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a broad set of application services over the Internet \cite{Amazon}. In total, Amazon provides over 50 different solutions where the main services include  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for compute, which is virtual servers in the Cloud; S3 for storage, providing scalable storage in the cloud; Aurora which is one of several databases, providing a High Performance Managed Relational Database. Amazon also provides several IoT solutions, for instance AWS IoT Platform, which is \textit{a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices}.

%Most existing application containers or platform-as-a-service solutions, while reducing the amount of programming required, significantly diminish developers’ flexibility and control. Developers are forced to live with all the decisions predetermined by the vendor–with little to no opportunity to take back control over various parts of their application’s infrastructure. However, with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, developers retain full control over the AWS resources powering their application. If developers decide they want to manage some (or all) of the elements of their infrastructure, they can do so seamlessly by using Elastic Beanstalk’s management capabilities.

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. \cite{predictive}

Amazon Web Services claim to have better cloud security than on-premises infrastructure \cite{Amazon}.

\section{Microsoft Azure}
Azure is the only consistent hybrid cloud on the market \cite{Azure}. Azure is the cloud for building intelligent applications. Data centers in 42 regions. Recognized as the most trusted cloud for U.S. government institutions, taking advantage of Microsoft security, privacy, and transparency. Ability to run any stack, Linux-based or Windows-based. Cloud Virtual Network is a comprehensive set of Google-managed networking capabilities, including granular IO address range selection, routes, firewall, VPN and Cloud Route. 

Microsoft virtualization solutions go beyond basic virtualization capabilities, such as consolidating server hardware yo create comprehensive platforms for private and hybrid cloud \cite{predictive}.  


\section{IBM}

\section{Google Cloud Platform}

You can also define fine-grained networking policies with Cloud Platform, on-premise or other public cloud infrastructure \cite{predictive}. Compute Engine - IaaS providing virtual machines, App Engine - PaaS for application hosting. Bigtable - IaaS massively scalable NoSQL database. BigQuery - SaaS large scale database analutics.
