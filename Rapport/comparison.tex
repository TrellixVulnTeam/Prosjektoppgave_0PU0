\chapter{Cloud Service Providers}
There are hundreds of different cloud service providers. Following is a overview of the currently six biggest providers \cite{10biggest} \cite{Forbestop}.

\section{Amazon Web Services}
Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing provider that offers a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a broad set of application services over the Internet \cite{Amazon}. In total, Amazon provides over 50 different solutions where the main services include  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for compute, which is virtual servers in the Cloud; S3 for storage, providing scalable storage in the cloud; Aurora which is one of several databases, providing a High Performance Managed Relational Database. Amazon also provides several IoT solutions, for instance AWS IoT Platform, which is \textit{a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices}.


Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. \cite{predictive}

Amazon Web Services claim to have better cloud security than on-premises infrastructure \cite{Amazon}.

\section{Microsoft Azure}

\section{Comparison}

\subsection{Azure vs. AWS}
According to Azure \cite{Azure}, they offer more regions than any other cloud provider, they posses unmatched hybrid capabilities and have the strongest intelligence. 
\textit{As the leading public cloud platforms, Azure and AWS each offer businesses a broad and deep set of capabilities with global coverage. Yet many organizations choose to use both platforms together for greater choice and flexibility, as well as to spread their risk and dependencies with a multicloud approach. Consulting companies and software vendors might also build on and use both Azure and AWS, as these platforms represent most of the cloud market demand.} Lists a table to compare AWS with Azure.

\subsection{IaaS}
AWS offers a range of tools that fall under IaaS, they are categorized into four classes: content delivery and storage, compute, networking, and database. They all use Amazon's identity and security services while at the same time have a range of management tools that users can use \cite{stackify}. 

Azure on also has four categorize of offerings, namely: data management and databases, compute, networking, and performance. Also Azure provides costumers with security and management tools. 

\subsection{PaaS}
AWS does not have as many options or features on the app hosting side. Microsoft has flexed their knowledge of developer tools to have a little bit of an advantage for hosting cloud apps \cite{stackify}.

\subsection{Hybrid Cloud}
Hybrid clouds are easier with Azure, partly because Microsoft has foreseen the need for hybrid clouds early on.  Azure offers substantial support for hybrid clouds, where you can use your onsite servers to run your applications on the Azure Stack.  You can even set your compute resources to tap cloud-based resources when necessary. This makes moving to the cloud seamless.  Aside from that, several Azure offerings help you maintain and manage hybrid clouds \cite{stackify}.

\subsection{Open Source Developers}
Amazon shines when it comes to open source developers.  Microsoft has historically been very closed to open source applications, and it turned a lot of companies off.  AWS, on the other hand, welcomed Linux users and offered several integrations for open source apps \cite{stackify}.

\subsection{Features}
On a per feature basis, you will find that most of all features offered on Azure have a corresponding or similar feature on AWS.  And while it will be quite difficult to come up with an exhaustive features list, you might find it interesting that some Azure services have no AWS equivalent. These include the Azure Visual Studio Online, Azure Site Recovery, Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Scheduler.  However, it seems that AWS is trying to close the gap.  For instance, AWS now offers AWS Lambda on preview to counter Azureâ€™s Logic Apps \cite{stackify}.


\section{Feature Comparison}

\subsection{Virtual Private Cloud and Privacy}

\subsubsection{Amazon Web Services}
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): lets you provision a logically isolated section of AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. Complete control over virtual network environment, including selection of IP address range, subnets, configuration of rout tables and network gateways. Easy to customize network configuration. Example of usage - public-facing subnet for webservers that has access to the Internet, and place backend systems such as databases in private-facing subnet with no Internet access. By routing traffic through a Network Address Translation (NAT), instances in a private subnet can access the Internet without exposing their private IP address. Traffic to and from instances in VPC can be routed to datacenter over an industry standard, encrypted IPsec hardware VPN connection.  Provides all the same benefits as the rest of the AWS platform. Disaster recovery - periodically backup mission critical data from datacenter to Amazon EC2. 

AWS Direct Connect: Makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection with private connectivity between AWS and your environment. May reduce network costs, increase bandwidth throughput and provide a more consistent network experience. Connection made to a specific region. Virtual interfaces allows you to access all AWS services or to connect to VPC.
